/** SEC-01 · Hero / Value Proposition.
 *
 * NOTE ON `src/components/Hero.tsx`: that existing component is this
 * site's own homepage hero — zero props (fully hardcoded copy), no
 * eyebrow, no CTA button, and its stats row is logos + big numbers in a
 * divided 4-column layout. It doesn't match SEC-01's spec on props,
 * render order, or content model, so this is a new component rather than
 * a reuse/edit of that one — see the task's own instruction to
 * verify-not-duplicate. Not modified; still in active use on the homepage.
 *
 * Trust badges went through a few iterations on request — logo images
 * matching the real Hero, then a centered no-divider layout — before
 * landing here on a single collapsed text line (no logos), which is what
 * ships now: each badge is plain text, joined on one line with `·`
 * separators.
 *
 * Render order: eyebrow → H1 → subhead → CTA → trust badges → image
 * h-stack. This is a deliberate deviation from SEC-01's originally-spec'd
 * order (trust badges before the CTA, and no image row at all) — trust
 * badges placed below the CTA, and a two-image h-stack added at the very
 * end, both on direct request. The image row is placeholder-only for now
 * (no image props yet) — matching this project's own placeholder
 * convention (`WorkGallery.tsx`'s `GalleryTile`: a labeled `bg-[#d9d7d0]`
 * box, muted uppercase caption) rather than wiring up `next/image`
 * against fabricated file paths that don't exist yet. Split 50/50 via
 * `flex-[50]`/`flex-[50]` (not raw `w-[50%]`/`w-[50%]`) so the ratio holds
 * against the *remaining* width after the gap is subtracted, rather than
 * the gap pushing the total past 100% — was 65/35 originally, evened out
 * to 50/50 on request. Corners are `rounded-[32px]`, the
 * same radius already used for every large image/card treatment
 * elsewhere in this project (ProjectCard, FeaturedPostCard,
 * ContainedImage, ...). Gap between the two images is `gap-4` (16px) —
 * started smaller (`gap-2`) on an earlier request, opened up slightly on
 * a follow-up.
 *
 * Optional `cards` prop (added on request, for /saas-web-app-development):
 * when passed, replaces the two placeholder image boxes with a floating
 * status-card canvas instead — up to 3 small white `HeroCard`s (timeline /
 * working / metrics, per the "Lassie-style" card system: Header row,
 * Status timeline, Working row, Metric list, Tag footer blocks) scattered
 * with slight rotation over a translucent panel (`HERO_CARD_POSITION_CLASSES`).
 * Every other page omits `cards` and keeps the original placeholder row —
 * fully backward compatible, opt-in per page rather than a global Hero
 * redesign. Card content is illustrative SaaS *output* (what a dashboard
 * would actually show), never marketing copy about Paistudio itself, per
 * the content rules it was written against — no fabricated Paistudio
 * claims live inside a card.
 *
 * Optional `images` prop: real images instead of the placeholder text,
 * originally the same two-box 50/50 row (`fill` + `object-cover`, static)
 * — now a continuously auto-scrolling horizontal marquee of the same two
 * images instead, on request ("masukin animasi kaya di workgallery... tapi
 * gambar bergerak horizontally"): reuses the exact `Marquee` primitive and
 * `.pai-hmarquee` CSS animation `WorkGallery.tsx` uses for its own
 * vertical marquee (including the same `prefers-reduced-motion` handling,
 * defined once in `globals.css` and shared by both), just with
 * `direction="horizontal"` instead of `"vertical"`. See `HeroMarqueeTile`
 * for why the row is now height-fixed with aspect-ratio-driven width
 * (the mirror of `GalleryTile`'s width-fixed/height-driven tiles) rather
 * than the old flex-[50]/flex-[50] split. Rendered as a sibling of the
 * `pai-container` div rather than nested inside it, so the marquee spans
 * the full viewport edge-to-edge instead of being capped at 1240px —
 * on request ("buat full-width sekarang masih kena max width"); every
 * other row in this component (text stack, `cards` canvas, placeholder
 * boxes) stays inside `pai-container` as before, this is the one
 * full-bleed exception. Each page now reuses its matching `WorkGallery`
 * project's real gallery via `getGalleryImages()`
 * (`src/lib/data/projects.ts`) rather than dedicated hero-only stills, on
 * request ("gunakan gambar yg dipake sesuai di work gallery") — see that
 * function's own doc comment for the id → page mapping. Ignored if
 * `cards` is also passed; omitted entirely on every other page, which
 * keeps the plain static placeholder boxes.
 *
 * Dark theme, now a green gradient rather than flat `bg-ink` — not in the
 * original spec, added on direct request to match "the index page's hero
 * section." The real Hero (src/components/Hero.tsx) has no background of
 * its own — its green comes from a separate `FixedBackground` layer
 * driven by `heroBgGradient()` (src/lib/scroll/gradients.ts), a
 * scroll-interpolated gradient spanning a 150vh canvas that eventually
 * fades to white. That machinery only makes sense wired into this site's
 * specific scroll pipeline, not a standalone reusable section, so this
 * bakes in a static gradient using `heroBgGradient(0)`'s own resting-state
 * colors instead (its first four stops — ATM_TOP → nearBlack → FOREST.g1
 * → FOREST.g2 — same near-black-to-forest-green sequence), capped before
 * the real gradient's later stops brighten toward white, since a bounded
 * section (unlike the homepage's scroll-through canvas) needs to stay
 * dark enough for the white text throughout to keep working.
 * `bg-[...]` sits on the outer, full-width `<section>`; the `pai-container`
 * max-width/padding wrapper is a separate inner `<div>` so the gradient
 * spans edge-to-edge instead of being boxed in at 1240px.
 *
 * Mobile aspect ratio (placeholder row only): each box's
 * `aspectRatio: "16 / 10"` inline style is unconditional — never
 * overridden at `max-[900px]`/`max-[560px]` — so the 16:10 shape itself
 * never changes between desktop and mobile, only the box's absolute pixel
 * size does. On mobile the row switches from `flex-[50]`/`flex-[50]` to a
 * stacked column (`max-[900px]:flex-col`); each box also gets an explicit
 * `max-[900px]:w-full` there rather than relying on flex's cross-axis
 * `stretch` default to imply full width — belt-and-suspenders against the
 * `aspect-ratio` + `flex-basis: auto` sizing interaction being a known
 * cross-browser rough edge, so the 16:10 ratio holds reliably everywhere
 * rather than depending on stretch resolving before aspect-ratio applies.
 * The `images` marquee row instead fixes the row's *height* per breakpoint
 * (`h-[360px]`/`max-[900px]:h-[240px]`/`max-[560px]:h-[180px]`) and lets
 * each tile's own `aspectRatio: "16 / 10"` drive its width — see
 * `HeroMarqueeTile`.
